          Introduction
      </div>
        Nurdles are threatening the very fabric of oceanic ecosystems around the world. Their destructive nature could cause extinction of many of the organisms that call our ocean home. If action isn't taken fast, serious damage will be done to the ocean, the planet, and us. 
        <br>
        <div class = "display-3" id = "Nurdles">
          So what's a nurdle?
        </div>
        <br>
        Nurdles are small plastic pellets ranging from the size of a fish egg to a grain of sand. They are produced by the oil and plastics industry, with ExxonMobil being the largest nurdle producer in the world. Nurdles start their life as natural gas and crude oil. The chemicals are sent to refineries where they are refined into Ethane and Propane. Then they can be sent to another chemical plant called a “cracker,” where they are converted into Ethylene and Propylene. The Ethylene and Propylene is then put through a process called “polymerization,” which bonds the Ethylene molecules together and Propylene molecules together, so that they form a chain like structure. When the two have converted into polymers they will have become the chemical compounds known as Polyethylene and Polypropylene. The Polypropylene and Polyethylene are now ready to become nurdles. To create the plastic products that we use day-to-day the nurdles must first be melted down at extreme temperatures into a plasticy-goo and set into a mold known as a dye. Once cooled, you have your desired plastic product.
        <br>
        <div class = "display-3" id = "Issue">
          What's the problem?
      </div>
        <br>
        Nurdles are great at what they do, they're durable, cheap to make, and can be produced in large quantities. However, they are too good at their job. The plastic products they make up may not biodegrade for centuries, if not millennia. Even when they biodegrade they typically break down into microplastics, which can be, in some cases, more toxic and damaging than their intact counterparts. Nurdles in their base form aren't the safest either. Because of the chemical compounds nurdles are made of, they can absorb other, even more toxic substances, like certain diseases or dangerous chemicals. When they trap in the harmful substances the nurdles can contaminate nearby ground water or lakes and streams, which could be devastating for local wildlife or unfortunate human beings. Because of their pernicious nature they could lead to harmful psychological effects. With nurdles being shipped around the world at an exponential amount, spillages have become more and more common. When shipped the plastic pellets are labeled specifically as “non-toxic,” even though they have an abundance of toxicity. As you can imagine this leads to numerous problems. For instance, when they are shipped overseas they are kept above deck, if they were labeled as toxic as they should be, they would be stored safely below deck almost immune to spillage. However, due to their labeling, when heavy winds or storms hit, the shipping containers fall into the sea, wreaking havoc on the local ecosystems and environments. It's easier for oil and plastic industries to label nurdle as non-toxic because it's cheaper, faster to ship, and less regulated.
        <br>
        <div class = "display-3" id = "Many">
          Why are we making so many?
      </div>
        <br>
        If nurdles are as harmful as they are, why don't we stop making them? Well, it's complicated. For the oil industry there is a big incentive to produce more plastic. It's estimated that there is roughly five hundred billion dollars in the plastic industry. And the oil industry is desperate to transition as well. With the demand for renewals on the rise, oil and natural gas have almost been overshadowed and that is expected to continue. So, the oil industry has found its new home in plastic. And they have only ramped up production. Since 1950 to now plastic production has increased roughly 245 times as of 2020. We went from producing 1.5 million metric tons of plastic in 1950 to 367 million metric tons in 2020. The growth is clear and they have no intent of slowing down. Unfortunately only 9% of all plastics have been recycled, the rest can either be buried, burnt, or are left to pollute the environment. U.S. based plastic companies have started dumping plastic waste and creating more plastic in developing countries, which don't have as strict of regulations as the United States. Which unfortunately makes those countries the plastic industry's own personal garbage dump.

        <div class = "display-3" id = "Help">
          How do we help?
      </div>
        <br>
        <ol>
         
        <li>One way to help is participating in Nurdle Patrol. You can get a nurdle collection kit for free as long as you participate at least once a month. At least once monthly you will need to take a beach survey. The survey requires that you search for nurdles at the beach for only ten minutes and submit your findings to their website. For more information head to <a href=“www.nurdlepatrol.org>their website</a>.  Another great option is donating to <a href=litter4tokens.org>Litter 4 tokens</a>. They do great work involving nurdles and, like nurdle-patrol, have options to collect and submit nurdles. </li>
        
        <li>Spreading the word, so to speak, is another viable option. A couple ways to do so include, creating short films, making posters, and informing people who don’t know what nurdles are. Informing the public is an incredibly effective way to create change.</li>
        
        <li>Another, more hands on approach, would be to protest. Protesting is very effective and is typically used to change legislation. If you can change legislation then that means stricter regulation on the import and export of nurdles, meaning a cleaner environment and cleaner beaches for us all.</li>
        </ol>        
          
        Note: If you would like to collect nurdles you can place heaps of sand into a strainer and use buckets or watering-cans to pour water. The wet-sand will fall through the strainer leaving the remaining nurdles in the strainer. We here at TheNurdleProblem have found this to be a very effective, easy, and cheap way to sift for nurdles.
